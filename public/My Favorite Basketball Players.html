<h1>My Favorite Basketball Players of All time</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Pick</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>
<p>"My favorite player is Kobe Bryant because of his unmatched dedication, 
    hard work, and 'Mamba Mentality.' He wasn’t just talented—he pushed himself 
    to be great every single day. I admire how he overcame challenges, played 
    through injuries, and always gave his best on the court. 
    
 <p>Kobe inspired people not just in basketball, but in life. His mindset, 
    work ethic, and will to win motivate me to be better in whatever I do."</p>

<h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
<p>"My favorite player is Michael Jordan because he’s the definition of 
    greatness. His killer instinct, clutch performances, and six NBA 
    championships show why he’s called the GOAT. What I admire most is 
    how he always delivered when it mattered, and how he made everyone around him better. 
    Watching his highlights still gives me chills. Jordan didn’t just play 
    basketball—he owned the game."</p>

<h3>Luka Doncic</h3>
<p>"My favorite player is Luka Dončić because he plays with insane skill, confidence, 
    and creativity. He makes the game look effortless—stepbacks, crazy passes, clutch 
    shots—you name it. Even at a young age, he plays like a seasoned vet. I love how he 
    stays calm under pressure and always puts on a show. Luka’s game is just fun to watch!"</p>
